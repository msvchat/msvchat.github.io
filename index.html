<h1>Welcome to the MS V-Chat Server Homepage</h1>
<p>The goal of this website is to share what ive found and links to my IRC server when those files are properly uploaded to this github.</p>
<p>There is A LOT of things I have put on my plate for this so please be patient with me.</p>
<p>I have chosen <a href="https://www.unrealircd.org/">UnrealIRCd</a> as my server software, I would have liked to have used <a href="https://www.officeirc.com">OfficeIRC</a> but funds are limited.</p>
<p>I need to write a proper guide for installing and running V-Chat on Windows 10/11. Its possible and it envolves installing parts of v-chat and then dgVoodoo to get it working.</p>
<p>After the guide tho, i REALLY want to focus on rewriting the vchat20.inf in the self extracting archive of the vchat2.exe, should be easy enough with 32bit iExpress and MSChat's(Comic Chat)installer file from ITS 32bit self extractable.</p>
<p>the purpose of that is so i can package the required files and detailed instructions for setting up dgVoodoo to get vchat working [as intended]</p>
<p>If you have any questions about updates coming or have information (world files, avatars)or solutions to issues im working on.</p>
