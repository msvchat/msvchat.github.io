<h1>Welcome to the MS V-Chat Server Homepage</h1>
<p>So far it seems the easiest method for what I want to do will be to use an old version of IRCPlus to host the server.</p>
<p>after the initial setup of the v-chat world files I might have to move over to a standard license for office IRC. which is still 100 dollars too expensive for something like this.(so far)</p>
