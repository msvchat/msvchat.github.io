						<p style="text-align:center">This website is the homepage of the MS V-Chat Museum IRC server and has guides for Microsoft V-Chat 2.0, the most important of which is getting V-Chat running on Windows 10/11!</p>
					</header>
					<main>
						<h4 style="color:red">Red links denote that the guide is incomplete or needs to be rewritten.</h4>
						<p>This site provides guides to Microsoft V-Chat and tools associated with it. I use <a href="https://www.officeirc.com"><span style="background-color:#4485b8;color:#fff;display:inline-block;padding:2px 8px;font-weight:700;border-radius:5px">OfficeIRC</span></a> as my IRC daemon for the MS V-Chat Museum IRC server.</p>
						<p><strong>If you have any questions, links to active websites on V-Chat I haven't listed, or have information (world files, avatars, active V-Chat servers) or solutions to issues im working on. PLEASE EMAIL ME. <a href="mailto:msvchatmuseum@outlook.com">msvchatmuseum@outlook.com</a> or join the discord server!</strong></p>
						<p><strong>12/19/22</strong> New website!</p>
						<p><strong>12/10/22</strong> I have added an archived link about creating avatars to <a style="color:red" href="customav.html">Creating an avatar</a></p>
						<p><strong>8/14/22</strong> I moved "2.0.0.220vchat2L.exe","AvaWiz2.exe", and "MSAUTH11.exe" to msvchat.000webhostapp.com. They are no longer zip files.</p>
						<p><strong>3/9/22</strong> Rewrote the guide for customizing a room and hosting it online.</p>
						<p><strong>10/30/2021</strong> I decided to move the world files and avatars to a seperate web host that lets older systems visit the rooms on the IRC and be able to experience them while still working for Windows 10/11.(I Tested the rooms and avatars with Windows XP on a virtual machine)</p>
						<p><strong>10/15/2021</strong> I got the audio working right finally. The issue was that some of the wav files were stereo and V-Chat did not like that. So using audacity I mixed stereo down to mono on the offending wav files. I also fixed a mistake I made with the room "#CWLovely" pointing to "#CWLordsCastle".</p>
						<p>The following rooms have corrupted audio files and are believed to be lost to time.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>#CWButterflyDreams<ul><li>collide.wav</li></ul></li>
							<li>#CWAliciaJazsLilPlace<ul><li>collide.wav</li><li>enter.wav</li><li>exit.wav</li></ul></li>
							<li>#CWHall<ul><li>collide.wav</li><li>enter.wav</li><li>exit.wav</li><li>song.wav</li></ul></li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>10/12/2021</strong>-The MS V-Chat Museum Discord is Open!</p>
				        <p><strong>9/16/2021</strong>-I have added all the non-adult avatars and *.lst files for easy avatar download!</p>
				        <p><strong>8/15/2021</strong>-The IRC Server now has 43 custom worlds a long side the Microsoft worlds for a total of 71 graphical rooms to explore!</p>
						<p><strong>8/3/2021</strong>-The license for OfficeIRC was acquired!</p>
						<h3 id="TODO">List of things I need to do</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Write some of the easier guides</li>
							<li>Repackaging the V-Chat installer to work better and include the files required to work with windows 10/11.</li>
						</ul> This means rewriting the vchat20.inf in the self extracting archive of the vchat2L.exe using the windows 95 resource kit as a guide, and then repackaging it with 64bit iExpress(located in C:/Windows/SysWOW64) or 32bit iExpress(located in C:/Windows/System32). The purpose of that is so I can package the required files and detailed instructions for setting up dgVoodoo to get V-Chat working [as close to as intended as possible] but for now follow the Install V-Chat guide I have made.
						<p>This site has guides compiled from multiple sources, most of which are archived in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>. </p>
						<p style="text-align:center"><h2 id="ABOUT">About me</h2> My name is Benjamin Gray. I first played V-Chat at a friend of mines house back in 1998. I was 11 or 12 but I thought it was amazing at the time and it's been stuck in my mind ever since. I used to use the name Kolestan back then if you search hard enough on the Wayback Machine you might find references to that username with v-chatterbox. I joined that forum on Jan 7th, 2004 and moderated the IRC servers section.</p>

						<h3>How I got the idea to start this site.</h3>
						<p>I was curious one day, and decided to look up Microsoft V-Chat on YouTube. I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlqHG5A_xto">this</a> YouTube video. I discovered that Barra had successfully got Microsoft V-Chat running on Windows 10 but I did not understand (at first) how to get it working so I worked through the process of getting it running and decided to help others do so with more detailed instructions.</p>
						<p>I was also aware of the <a href="https://archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and thought if I dug deep enough I might also find lost content for Microsoft V-Chat. And so I began the process of gathering what I could and linking up with other people who have sites or videos on Microsoft V-Chat.</p>
						<p>It's all thanks to Barra that this site even exists!</p>
						<p>Thank you Barra!</p>

							<li>Barra's <a href="https://barrarchiverio.7m.pl/">website</a>
							<li>Barra's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/eduardobarra352/">YouTube</a></ul>
						</ul>
						<p>I had a chance to speak with Chris Liles (who went by "tooner") the creator for the original V-Chat artwork, member of the original V-Chat team, and co-designer of the avatars (with Manny Vellon). We spoke in an email conversation and they told me what they were up to now! Check out <a href="https://angrysheepstudios.wixsite.com/outback2/about">Tails of the Outback</a>!</p>
