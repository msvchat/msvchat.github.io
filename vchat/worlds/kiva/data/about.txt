This space has been provided by TOONED IN.

The design of this environment is based loosely on the 
Chetro Ketl Great Kiva located at Chaco Canyon, in New 
Mexico.  Our depiction captures the spirit of the 
location, but does not accurately portray the 
architectural or environmental details of the site.  

For accurate archaeological information about Chetro 
Ketl, see the site provided by the Humanities and 
Social Sciences Department at the University of 
Santa Barbara:

The images and links contained in this environment are 
intended to provide a cross-sectional view of American 
Indian culture, without representing any particular 
religious beliefs or practices.  

We welcome your comments for making this space more 
enjoyable.
