The design of this environment is based loosely on the
Chetro Ketl Great Kiva located at Chaco Canyon, in New
Mexico.  Our depiction captures the spirit of the
location, but does not accurately portray the
architectural or environmental details of the site.
For accurate archaeological information about Chetro
Ketl, see the site provided by the Humanities and
Social Sciences Department at the University of
Santa Barbara:

The images and links contained in this environment are
intended to provide a cross-sectional view of American
Indian culture, without representing any particular
religious beliefs or practices.
We welcome your comments for making this space more
enjoyable.
