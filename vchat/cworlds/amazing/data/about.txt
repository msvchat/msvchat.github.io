Well this is the first room created from
 scratch using the recently hacked World
 Database file data structure. It uses a
 complex wall hit detection, to make
 opake, close to 80 surfaces, the room
 plan was first designed in 'Corel Draw'
 using a 100 unit square grid, values
 range from -50 to 50 in x & z, this was
 exported as a dxf file and errata
 removed using a simple macro in 'Word',
 values were then entered directly into
the WDB file using 'Hexpert', block
 copies, duplication and fills were done
 using 'Code Genie'. This version is
 public domain and all are welcome to
 add their graphics, a mention of the
 author would be appreciated.
