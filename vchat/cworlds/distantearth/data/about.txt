Logbook

Year 2495 AC

.......we have crashed onto this planet just out 
of the Solar system.

Something did not work with the spacetime distortion
comparator and the engines.
We were heading to Sirio B system, but jumped off out here,
too close to the planet to overcome gravity 
with engines at 15% residual power.

We were left with the wrecked main ship,
two shuttles, and 23 members of the crew.
The liquid oxygen tanks are still intact, 
so we can produce a breathable atmosphere
in the cabins, and some food cases are left too..

The shuttles are unceasingly flying to explore and 
find  for some place where to settle and get food.
The Bio-analizers have detected presence of life 
and vegetation.

We do not have much time...

Nights do appear strange here, 
the earth is in place of the moon,
and we stare it, 
as our thoughts go to what we left there,
meanwhile she hangs in the sky, 
silently spinning around...........
