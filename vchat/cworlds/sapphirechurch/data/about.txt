Original application from Microsoft Corporation. Made with Author 1.1. Sorry that application is incomplete but I believe this is a creditable job. This room was done at the request of SapphireChild so it will be called Sapphire_Church. Also sorry about the download time but I hope the wait is well worth it.There were some things I just didn't want to compromise on when it came to size, although I did compromise on the textures.

Also, this world is in Dedication to Sapphire_Child(aka As-Angel Mikki)... she was the last angel on MSN V-chat when all others had quit long before the final pull of the plug. That's dedication and faith I very rarely see these days. It was a pleasure working on this world for her.
